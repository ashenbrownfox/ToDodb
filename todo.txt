-Can someone create a db for user login
-I'll implement a login system for now - Kelvin


---------------------------------------
1- Run the new SQL that is in the folder SQLDB. 
2- We could start to use that DB as a starting point. 
3- We dont need to worry about security. (probably) // 
4- DRY and KISS. (Don't repeat yourself and Keep is simple. )
